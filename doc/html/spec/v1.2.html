	    <h3>Overview</h3>

	    <p>A BGEN file consists of a header block, giving general infomation about the file,
			and an optional sample identifier block.  These are followed by a series of <em>variant data</em> blocks,
			stored consecutively in the file, which each contain data for a single genetic variant.  To allow for
			potential future additions to the spec, the first variant data block is located using an offset stored in
			the first four bytes of the file.
		</p>
		<p>
			The format in which variant data blocks are stored is determined by a set of flag bits stored in the header
			block.  Currently two formats are supported - Layout 1 blocks which are a direct translation to binary
			of the GEN format; and Layout 2 blocks, which are both more space-efficient and more flexible, including
			support for genotype and haplotype data, multi-allelic variants, and non-diploid samples.
			An older format, used in the
			v1.0 spec, is now deprecated and is no longer documented in this spec.
		</p>

	    <h3>Data types</h3>
		<div class="collapsible">
		    <p>All numbers in a BGEN file are stored as unsigned integers in little endian (least
		    significant byte first) order. This choice coincides with the memory layout used
		    on most common architectures - see the <a href=
		    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">wikipedia page</a> for more details.
			</p>
		    <p>Variant identifiers, chromosome identifiers, and other string fields are stored as a two- or four-byte integer length
				followed by the data itself (which does not include a C-style trailing zero byte).
			</p>
		    <p>Genotype probabilities are stored in an efficient packed bit representation described in detail below.</p>
		    <p>Finally, some fields in BGEN are interpreted as flags encoded as a bitmask.</p>
		</div>
    <h3>The first four bytes</h3>
	<div class="collapsible">
	    <p>The first four bytes of the file encode an unsigned integer indicating the offset,
	    relative to the 5th byte of the file, of the start of the first variant data block, or the end
	    of the file if there are 0 variant data blocks. For example, if this offset is 20 (the
	    minimum possible because the header block always has size at least 20) then the variant data
	    blocks start at byte 25.</p>

    <h3>Sample identifier block</h3>

    <p>If <em>SampleIdentifiers</em>=1 in the flags field, the header block is immediately followed by a
    sample identifier block.  This stores a single identifier per sample.
	</p>
	<p><em>Note</em>: BGEN treats sample
	identifiers as a string of bytes, and does not impose any additional restrictions. 
	However, for the simplest interoperability with other software (e.g. for <a href=
    "http://www.r-project.org">R</a>'s <a href=
    "https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/make.names.html">make.names</a>
    ) it is often sensible to restrict to ASCII alphanumeric characters, underscores, and full stop.

    <h3>Variant data blocks</h3>

    <p>Following the header comes a sequence of <em>M</em> variant data blocks (where <em>M</em> is the number
		specified in the header block).
		This document describes SNP blocks for spec versions 1.1 and above.
		Version 1.0 is deprecated and should not be used in new files.

    <p>Variant data blocks are comprised of: a section of identifying data (containing variant IDs,
    position, and alleles), followed by a section containing the genotype probability
    data itself.  Most files will have  <em>CompressedSNPBlocks=1</em>, indicating
	that genotype probability data is stored compressed.  (The variant identifying data
	is never compressed, however.)

		<h4>Probability data storage</h4>
            <p>
				For Layout 1 blocks, probability data is stored as a sequence of 2-byte unsigned integers.
				These should be interpreted in triples,
				the first member being the probability of a homozygous 'AA' allele,
				the second the probability of 'AB',
				the third the probability of 'BB', where A and B are the two alleles at the variant.
				When <em>CompressedSNPBlocks</em> is not set, these 6 * <em>N</em> bytes are
				stored in the file directly.  When <em>CompressedSNPBlocks>0</em>, these 6*<em>N</em>
				bytes are first compressed using <a href="http://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a>
				and the length of the compressed data is stored as the 4-byte integer <em>C</em>,
				followed by the compressed data itself.
            </p>
            <p>
				To convert the stored 2-byte integers into probabilities, the following calculation should be performed:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Convert the number into a floating-point format (e.g. float or double).</li>
				<li>Divide by 32,768.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Note that the range of a two-byte unsigned integer is 0 - 65,535 inclusive. Thus the resulting probabilities
                can take on values between 0 and 65,535/32768 ~ 1.9999 inclusive and they are accurate to four decimal places.
			</p>
			<p>
				To convert a floating point probability to its integer representation, do the following:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Multiply by 32,768.</li>
				<li>Check that the number is in the half-open interval [0,65535.5) and round to the nearest integer.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				All numbers are stored in little-endian (least significant byte first) order.
				Probabilities for samples with missing genotype data should be stored as zero.

    <h4>Per-sample order of stored probabilities</h4>

    <p>Consider a sample with ploidy <em>Z</em> and a variant with <em>K</em>
    alleles.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>For <b>phased data</b>, probabilities are stored in the order of haplotypes and
      then alleles, ie:

        <div class="displayFormula">
          <em>P<sub>11</sub></em>, <em>P<sub>12</sub></em>, ...,
          <em>P<sub>1(K-1)</sub></em>, <em>P<sub>21</sub></em>, ...,
          <em>P<sub>2(K-1)</sub></em>, ..., <em>P<sub>Z1</sub></em>, ...,
          <em>P<sub>Z(K-1)</sub></em>.
        </div>where <em>P<sub>ij</sub></em> is the probability that haplotype <em>i</em>
        has allele <em>j</em>. For each haplotype <em>i</em> the probability of the Kth
        allele (<em>P<sub>iK</sub></em>) is not stored; instead it is inferred as one
        minus the sum of other probabilities for that haplotype.  Thus a total of <em>Z(K-1)</em>
		probabilities are stored.
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>For <b>unphased data</b>, enumerate the possible genotypes as the set of <em>K</em>-vectors
			of nonnegative integers <em>(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ..., x<sub>K</sub>)</em>,
			where <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> represents the count of the <em>i</em>-th allele in the genotype.
			Probabilities are stored in <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Lexicographic_and_colexicographic_order">colex order</a> of these vectors.  The last
			probability (corresponding the the <em>K</em>-th allele homozygotes) is not stored; instead
			it is inferred as one minus the sum of other probabilities.  Thus a total of
			<em>( Z+K-1 )</em> <code>choose</code> <em>( K-1 )</em>-1 probabilities is stored.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Example</b>. For example if <em>Z=3</em> and <em>K=3</em> then the enumerated genotypes
			with allele count representations are:
		</p>
		<table class = "allele_counts">
			<tr><th>Index</th><th>Genotype</th><th>Allele counts</th></tr>
			<tr><td>0</td><td>111</td><td>(3,0,0)</td>
			<tr><td>1</td><td>112</td><td>(2,1,0)</td></tr>
			<tr><td>2</td><td>122</td><td>(1,2,0)</td></tr>
			<tr><td>3</td><td>222</td><td>(0,3,0)</td></tr>
			<tr><td>4</td><td>113</td><td>(2,0,1)</td></tr>
			<tr><td>5</td><td>123</td><td>(1,1,1)</td></tr>
			<tr><td>6</td><td>223</td><td>(0,2,1)</td></tr>
			<tr><td>7</td><td>133</td><td>(1,0,2)</td></tr>
			<tr><td>8</td><td>233</td><td>(0,1,2)</td></tr>
			<tr><td>9</td><td>333</td><td>(0,0,3)</td></tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			The stored probabilities are thus
        <div class="displayFormula">
			<em>P<sub>111</sub></em>,<em>P<sub>112</sub></em>, <em>P<sub>122</sub></em>, <em>P<sub>222</sub></em>,
			<em>P<sub>113</sub></em>, <em>P<sub>123</sub></em>, <em>P<sub>223</sub></em>,
			<em>P<sub>133</sub></em>, <em>P<sub>233</sub></em>
        </div>
		<p>
			with <em>P<sub>333</sub></em> inferred as one minus the sum of the other probabilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			The colex order has the important property that the genotypes that for each <em>i</em> the genotypes carrying
			the <em>i</em>-th allele appear later in the order than those that carry only alleles <em>1,...,i-1</em>.
			See the <a href='#rationale'>rationale</a> below for
			a further discussion of this choice of storage order.

    <h4>Representation of probabilities</h4>
	<p>
		For both genotype and haplotype data, each probability value is stored using <em>B</em> bits as follows.
		An integer of length <em>B</em> bits can represent the values <em>0, ..., 2<sup>B</sup>-1</em> inclusive.
		To interpret a stored value <em>x</em> as a probability:
		<ol>
			<li>Convert <em>x</em> to an integer in floating-point representation.
			<li>Divide by <em>2<sup>B</sup>-1</em>.</li>
		</ol>
		Thus, probabilities stored in Layout 2 blocks take possible values of the form <em>x/(2<sup>B</sup>-1) &in; [0,1]</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Storing probabilities to the limited precision afforded by <em>B</em> bits requires a rounding rule, which we specify as follows.
		Given a vector <em>v=(v<sub>1</sub>, ...v<sub>d</sub>)</em> of <em>d</em>
		probabilities that sum to one, we round by finding the closest point to <em>v</em> of the
		form <em>x/(2<sup>B</sup>-1)</em> where the entries of <em>x</em> are
		nonnegative integers summing to (2<sup>B</sup>-1).  The integer vector <em>x</em> can be
		found by the following algorithm:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Multiply <em>v</em> by <em>2<sup>B</sup>-1</em>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Compute the total fractional part <em>F = &Sum;<sub>i</sub> (v<sub>i</sub>- </em>floor<em>(v<sub>i</sub>))</em>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Form <em>x</em> by rounding the <em>F</em> entries of <em>v</em> with the largest fractional parts up to the nearest integer,
				and the other <em>d-F</em> entries down to the nearest smaller integer.
			</li>
		</ol>
		The results of <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-013-0126-2">Bomze et al, 2014</a>
		imply that <em>x/(2<sup>B</sup>-1)</em> is the nearest point to <em>v</em> that can be stored in the BGEN format with
		<em>B</em> bits.
	</p>
	<p>
		The maximum error in a probability stored using this rounding rule is <em>1/(2<sup>B</sup>-1)</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In practice we there may be some rounding error in probabilities input into the BGEN format.
		We therefore renormalise input probabilities to sum to one.
