				<h2>Detailed specification</h2>
				<p>
				A <em>BGEN</em> file consists of a header block, followed by a series of blocks called snp blocks.  The first four
				bytes of the file indicate the start position of the first snp block (relative to the fifth byte of the file).
				<p>
					<b>Note: All numbers in the file are stored as integers in little endian (least significant byte first)
                    order.</b>  This choice coincides with the memory layout
                    used on most common architectures. see the <a
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">wikipedia page</a> for more details.
				</p>
				<h3>The first four bytes</h3>
				<p>
				The first four bytes of the file encode an unsigned integer indicating the offset, relative to the 5th byte of the file, of the
                start of the first snp block (or the end of the file if there are 0 snp blocks). 
				For example, if this offset is 20 (the minimum possible because the header block always has size at least 20) then the snp blocks start at byte 25.

                       byte of the file, of the first byte of the first snp block (or the end of the file if there are no
                       snp blocks).</td></tr>

				<h3>The header block</h3>

            <p>
            The following flags can be contained in the <em>flags</em> field in the header block. <b>Note</b>: all bits not listed here must be set to 0.

				<h3>SNP blocks</h3>
				<p>
					Following the header comes a sequence of 0 or more SNP blocks.
	 				Each SNP block consists of the following data in order.
	 				(Note: the following description is valid when <em>LongIds</em>=1. When <em>LongIds</em>=0, SNP blocks are layout out as per the v1.0 spec, described <a href="bgen_format_v1.0.html">here</a>.)

                 	If <em>CompressedSNPBlocks</em> is set, this field contains a 32-bit unsigned integer specifying the length of the compressed data,
					followed by the compressed data itself.  See below for details of the storage scheme used.</td></tr>

			<h3>SNP block probability data</h3>
            <p>
					The probability data is listed as a sequence of 2-byte unsigned integers.  These should be interpreted in triples,
					the first member being the probability of AA, the second the probability of AB, the third the probability of BB.
					Altogether these occupy 6*<em>N</em> bytes where <em>N</em> is the number of samples.  When <em>CompressedSNPBlocks</em> is not set, these 6 * <em>N</em> bytes are
					stored directly.  When <em>CompressedSNPBlocks</em> is set, these 6 * <em>N</em> bytes are first compressed using <a href="http://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a>, and
					the length of the compressed data is stored as a 4-byte integer, followed by the compressed data itself.
            </p>
            <p>
					To convert the stored 2-byte integers into probabilities, the following calculation should be performed:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Convert the number into a floating-point format (e.g. float or double).</li>
					<li>Divide by 32,768.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Note that the range of a two-byte unsigned integer is 0 - 65,535 inclusive. Thus the resulting probabilities
                    can take on values between 0 and 65,535/32768 ~ 1.9999 inclusive and they are accurate to four decimal places.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Note</b>: to convert a floating point probability to its integer representation, do the following:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Multiply by 32,768.</li>
					<li>Check that the number is in the half-open interval [0,65535.5) and round to the nearest integer.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					All numbers are stored in little-endian (least significant byte first) order.
